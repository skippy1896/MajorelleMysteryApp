Escoria in Daïza
==============

![Welcome screen](https://github.com/flossmanualsfr/escoria/blob/master/device/ui/start-screen-escoria-in-daiza.png)

**Escoria in Daïza** video game started its development during a book sprint organized by the [french-speaking branch of Floss Manuals](http://fr.flossmanuals.net/) between the 22th and 26th of August 2016 in Rennes, France, with the goal of writing a manual for [Creating Point and Click Games with Escoria](https://fr.flossmanuals.net/creating-point-and-click-games-with-escoria/). It's based on the original [Peril in Daïza](http://perilendaiza.com/) game, created during a previous book sprint.
This game was created and produced by the team of authors with three purposes: to create screenshots for the manual, to show that it's possible to quickly create a game using Escoria, and to showcase its features.
Since then, development on the project continues.
