Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.
Section 1 – Definitions.
Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.
Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
Section 2 – Scope.

License grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
Downstream recipients.
Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
Other rights.

Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.
Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

Attribution.

If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
a copyright notice;
a notice that refers to this Public License;
a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.
Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.
The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.
Section 6 – Term and Termination.

This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.
Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
Section 8 – Interpretation.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.
To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
"Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
"License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
"Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
For the avoidance of doubt:
Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

Licence
L'ŒUVRE (TELLE QUE DEFINIE CI-DESSOUS) EST MISE A DISPOSITION SELON LES TERMES DE CETTE LICENCE PUBLIQUE CREATIVE COMMONS (CI-APRES DENOMMEE « LPCC » OU « LICENCE »). L'ŒUVRE EST PROTEGEE PAR LE DROIT DE LA PROPRIETE LITTERAIRE ET ARTISTIQUE OU TOUTE AUTRE LOI APPLICABLE. TOUTE UTILISATION DE L'ŒUVRE AUTRE QUE CELLE AUTORISEE PAR CETTE LICENCE EST RÉSERVÉE.
L’EXERCICE DE TOUT DROIT SUR L’ŒUVRE MISE A DISPOSITION EMPORTE ACCEPTATION DES TERMES DE LA LICENCE. EN RAISON DU CARACTERE CONTRACTUEL DE LA LICENCE, L’OFFRANT ACCORDE A L’ACCEPTANT LES DROITS CONTENUS DANS CETTE LICENCE EN CONTREPARTIE DE SON ACCEPTATION.
1. Définitions
Adaptation : œuvre créée soit à partir de l’Œuvre seule, soit à partir de l’Œuvre et d’autres œuvres préexistantes. Constituent notamment des Adaptations, les traductions, adaptations, œuvres composites, arrangements ou modifications d’une œuvre littéraire et artistique, d’un phonogramme, d’un vidéogramme ou d’une interprétation d’une œuvre, y compris les adaptations cinématographiques ou toute autre forme dans laquelle l’Œuvre est susceptible d’être refondue, transformée ou adaptée, notamment toute forme dérivée de l’original de manière identifiable. Il est toutefois entendu qu’une Œuvre qui constitue une Collection ne sera pas considérée comme une Adaptation aux fins de la présente Licence. Au cas où l’Œuvre serait une création musicale, une interprétation ou un phonogramme, la synchronisation de l’Œuvre avec une image animée sera considérée comme une Adaptation aux fins de la présente Licence.
Collection : recueil d’œuvres qui, en raison de la sélection et de l’arrangement de son contenu, constitue une création intellectuelle dans laquelle chaque Œuvre se trouve incluse dans son ensemble, sous une forme non modifiée, avec une ou plusieurs autres contributions, chacune d’elles constituant des œuvres en elles-mêmes indépendantes et distinctes qui sont rassemblées pour former cet ensemble. Constituent notamment des Collections, les encyclopédies, anthologies, interprétations, phonogrammes, vidéogrammes ou émissions, ou toute œuvre autre que celles désignées à l’article 1(h). Aux fins de la présente Licence, une création qui constitue une Collection ne sera pas considérée comme une Adaptation (telle que définie ci-dessus).
Distribution : mise à disposition du public de la version originale ou des copies de l'Œuvre ou d'une Adaptation, par la vente ou tout autre transfert de propriété ou par tout mode de communication au public dans la mesure où ces activités sont sources de droits exclusifs (location, prêt, etc).
Éléments de la Licence : attributs de la Licence tels qu'ils ont été choisis par l'Offrant et qui figurent dans le titre de cette Licence : Attribution – Partage à l'Identique.
Licence Compatible Creative Commons : licence qui est listée à https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses qui a été approuvée par Creative Commons substantiellement équivalente à cette Licence, parce que, au minimum, cette licence : (i) contient des conditions qui ont le même objectif, la même signification et le même effet que les Éléments de la Licence de cette Licence; et, (ii) permet explicitement de re-licencier les adaptations d'œuvres mises à disposition selon les termes de cette licence, sous cette Licence ou une licence Creative Commons d'une juridiction qui comporte les mêmes Éléments que cette Licence.
Offrant : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) ou la ou les entité(s) qui mettent l’Œuvre à la disposition du public selon les termes de la présente Licence.
Titulaire de Droits Originaire : dans l’hypothèse d’une œuvre littéraire ou artistique, l’Auteur, entendu comme la ou les personnes physiques ou morales ou les entités qui ont créé l'Œuvre; et en outre, le cas échéant, (i) dans l’hypothèse d’une interprétation, les acteurs, chanteurs, musiciens, danseurs, ou toute autre personne qui joue, chante, déclame ou interprète l’œuvre littéraire, artistique ou folklorique; (ii) dans l’hypothèse d’un phonogramme ou d’un vidéogramme, le producteur, entendu comme la personne physique ou morale qui procède à la première fixation de l’interprétation sur un support; (iii) dans l’hypothèse d’une émission, l’entreprise de communication audiovisuelle qui procède à la diffusion de l’émission; (iv) dans l’hypothèse d’une base de données, le producteur.
Œuvre : création protégeable par le droit de la propriété littéraire et artistique (droits d'auteur, droits voisins et droits sui generis des producteurs de bases de données) mise à disposition selon les termes de la Licence. Peuvent notamment constituer une Œuvre toute création dans le domaine littéraire, scientifique et artistique, quel qu'en soit le mode ou la forme d'expression, y compris sous forme numérique, telle qu’un livre, un pamphlet et autres écrits ; une conférence, une allocution, une plaidoirie, un cours ou un sermon ou d'autres œuvres de même nature ; une œuvre dramatique ou une comédie musicale ; une œuvre chorégraphique ou un pantomime ; une composition musicale avec ou sans paroles ; une œuvre cinématographique à laquelle sont assimilées des œuvres exprimées par un procédé analogue à la cinématographie ; un dessin, une peinture, une création architecturale, une sculpture, une gravure ou une lithographie ; une création photographique à laquelle sont assimilées des œuvres exprimées par un procédé analogue à la photographie ; une œuvre des arts appliqués ; une œuvre graphique et typographique ; une illustration, une carte, un plan, un croquis ou une œuvre tridimensionnelle relative à la géographie, la topographie, l'architecture ou aux sciences ; une interprétation, une émission ; un phonogramme ou un vidéogramme ; une anthologie ou un recueil d’œuvres ou de données diverses ou une base de données dans la mesure où elle est protégée par le droit d’auteur ou le droit des producteurs de bases de données à la condition que celles-ci soient protégées par le droit applicable qui ne couvre pas seulement les bases de données protégées par le droit d'auteur (pour éviter toute ambiguïté, les sections 3(a), 3(b) et 3(c) ne s'appliqueront pas quand seul le droit des producteurs de bases de données s'applique); une interprétation réalisée par un artiste de cirque ou de variété ; les créations des industries saisonnières de l'habillement et de la parure.
Acceptant : la ou les personne(s) physique(s) ou morale(s) ou entité(s) qui exercent sur l’Œuvre les droits accordés par cette Licence et qui n’ont pas précédemment violé les conditions de cette Licence ou qui ont reçu l’autorisation expresse de la part de l’Offrant d’exercer les droits conférés par cette licence malgré une violation précédente.
Représentation : représentation de l’Œuvre et communications au public de ces représentations publiques par un procédé quelconque, quelque soit le type de transmission, notamment numérique et incluant les modes d’exploitation prévus par le droit applicable. Constitue également notamment une communication au public, la mise à disposition d’Œuvres protégées de manière à ce que le public puisse y avoir accès de l’endroit et au moment qu’il choisit individuellement, les interprétations et communications au public des interprétations de l'Œuvre y compris les interprétations publiques au format numérique ainsi qu’une diffusion ou une rediffusion de l’Œuvre par tout moyen, notamment par des signes, des sons ou des images.
Reproduction : toute copie de l'Œuvre de quelque manière et sous quelque forme que ce soit, notamment numérique et incluant les modes d'exploitation prévus par le droit applicable. Constitue aussi notamment une Reproduction, un enregistrement sonore ou visuel, une fixation ou une reproduction de fixations de l'Œuvre, y compris le stockage d'une interprétation, d’un phonogramme ou d’un vidéogramme au format numérique ou sur tout autre support électronique.
2. Exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs. Les exceptions et limitations aux droits exclusifs prévues par la loi applicable ne sont pas affectées par la présente Licence.
3. Étendue de l’autorisation. Sous réserve des conditions de la présente Licence, l’Offrant autorise l’Acceptant à exercer à titre gratuit, non-exclusif, pour la durée de protection des droits applicables et pour le monde entier, les droits de :
Reproduire, Distribuer et Représenter l'Œuvre, incorporer l'Œuvre dans une ou plusieurs Collections et reproduire l'Œuvre même incorporée dans lesdites Collections ;
Créer, Reproduire, Distribuer et Représenter des Adaptations, à la condition que ces Adaptations, notamment toute traduction sur tout support, soient accompagnées des mentions appropriées par étiquetage, démarcation ou identification de manière à faire apparaître clairement que des modifications ont été apportées à l’Œuvre. Par exemple, une traduction pourrait porter la mention « L’œuvre originaire a été traduite du français à l’anglais » ou en cas de modification « L’œuvre originaire a été modifiée » ;
Lorsque l'Œuvre est une base de données soumise au droit des producteurs de bases de données, extraire et réutiliser des parties substantielles.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté :
Régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire.
Dans les cas où des utilisations de l'Œuvre seraient soumises à un régime légal de gestion collective obligatoire (auquel le droit ne permet pas de renoncer), l'Offrant se réserve le droit exclusif de collecter ces redevances par l'intermédiaire de la société de perception et de répartition des droits compétente. Sont notamment concernés la radiodiffusion et la communication dans un lieu public de phonogrammes publiés à des fins de commerce, certains cas de retransmission par câble et satellite, la copie privée d'Œuvres fixées sur phonogrammes ou vidéogrammes, la reproduction par reprographie, le prêt en bibliothèque ;
Régime de gestion collective obligatoire assorti de possibilité de renonciation.
Dans les juridictions où il est possible de renoncer au droit de percevoir des redevances au titre d'un quelconque régime de licence légale ou de gestion collective obligatoire, l’Offrant renonce au droit exclusif de percevoir lesdites redevances découlant de l’exercice par l’Acceptant des droits consentis en vertu de la présente Licence ;
Régime de gestion collective facultative.
L’Offrant renonce au droit de percevoir des redevances (que ce soit à titre individuel ou, au cas où l’Offrant serait membre d’un organisme de gestion collective facultative, par le biais de cet organisme) découlant de l’exercice par l’Acceptant des droits accordés par la présente Licence.
Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus peuvent être exercés sur tous supports, médias, procédés, techniques et dans tous formats, incluant, dans la mesure du possible, les futurs médias et formats. Les droits mentionnés ci-dessus incluent le droit d'effectuer les modifications techniquement nécessaires à leur exercice sur d’autres supports, médias, procédés, techniques et formats. Les droits qui ne sont pas expressément accordés par l’Offrant à l’Acceptant par la présente Licence sont réservés. Dans le cas où l'Offrant est titulaire de droits sui generis sur les bases de données conformément à la loi nationale transposant la Directive Européenne sur les bases de données, l'Offrant renonce à ce droit.
4. Restrictions. L'autorisation accordée par l'Article 3 est expressément soumise et limitée par les restrictions suivantes :
L'Acceptant peut Distribuer ou Représenter l'Œuvre uniquement selon les termes de cette licence. Il doit inclure une copie de la Licence, ou son Identifiant Uniforme de Ressource (URI), à toute copie de l'Œuvre qu'il Distribue ou Représente. L'Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d'utilisation sur l'Œuvre qui restreignent les termes de la Licence ou la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur d'exercer les droits qui lui sont accordés par cette Licence. L'Acceptant ne peut consentir de sous-licence sur l'Œuvre. Il doit conserver intacts tous les avertissements qui se réfèrent à cette Licence et l’avertissement sur les garanties avec chaque copie de l’Œuvre qu’il distribue ou représente. Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente l’Œuvre, il ne doit pas imposer de mesure technique de protection susceptible de restreindre la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur à exercer les droits conférés par la présente Licence. L’article 4(a) s’applique à l’Œuvre telle qu’incorporée dans une Collection, mais n’a pas pour effet d’imposer que la Collection soit soumise aux conditions de la Licence. Si l'Acceptant crée une Collection, il doit, à la demande de tout Offrant et dans la mesure du possible, supprimer de la Collection toute référence audit Offrant, selon les modalités de l’Article 4(c), et ce conformément à la demande. Si l'Acceptant crée une Adaptation, il doit, à la demande de tout Offrant et dans la mesure du possible, supprimer de l'Adaptation toute référence audit Offrant, selon les modalités de l’Article 4(c), et ce conformément à la demande.
L'Acceptant peut distribuer ou représenter une Adaptation uniquement sous les conditions : (i) de cette Licence ; (ii) d'une version ultérieure de cette Licence comprenant les mêmes Éléments de la Licence ; (iii) d'une licence Creative Commons non transposée or transposée dans une juridiction (dans cette version ou dans une version ultérieure de la licence) comprenant les mêmes Elements de la Licence (par exemple la licence « Attribution - Partage à l'Identique 3.0 Japon » (la « Licence Applicable ») ; (iv) d'une Licence Creative Commons Compatible. L'Acceptant peut distribuer une Adaptation selon l'une des licences mentionnées dans (iv) à la condition de respecter les conditions de cette licence. L'Acceptant doit distribuer l'Adaptation selon l'une des licences mentionnées dans (i), (ii) ou (iii) (la “Licence Applicable”) à la condition de respecter les termes de la Licence Applicable d'une manière générale et les dispositions suivantes :
L'Acceptant doit inclure une copie, ou l'URI, de la Licence Applicable à toute copie de chaque Adaptation qu'il Reproduit, Distribue ou Représente.
L'Acceptant ne peut pas offrir ou imposer de conditions d'utilisation sur l'Adaptation qui restreignent les termes de la Licence Applicable, ou l'exercice des droits accordés au bénéficiaire de l'Adaptation par la Licence Applicable.
Il doit conserver intacts tous les avertissements qui se réfèrent à la Licence Applicable et à l’avertissement sur les garanties avec chaque copie de l’œuvre telle qu’incluse dans l’Adaptation que l’Acceptant distribue ou représente.
Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente une Adaptation, il ne doit pas imposer de mesure technique de protection sur l’Adaptation susceptible de restreindre la capacité du bénéficiaire ultérieur d’exercer les droits accordés par la Licence Applicable. Le présent article 4(b) s’applique à l’Adaptation telle qu’incorporée dans une collection, mais n’a pas pour effet d’imposer que la collection en dehors de l’Adaptation elle-même soit soumise aux conditions de la Licence Applicable.
Sauf introduction d’une demande prévue à l’Article 4(a), l'Acceptant doit, lorsqu'il distribue ou représente l'Œuvre, ou toute Adaptation ou Collection, garder intacts tous les avertissements sur les droits d’auteur concernant l’Œuvre et fournir, de manière appropriée au support ou au média qu'il utilise : (i) le nom du Titulaire de Droits Originaire (ou le pseudonyme, le cas échéant) s'il est mentionné, et/ou si le Titulaire de Droits Originaire et/ou l’Offrant désigne une ou des parties (par exemple un organisme de financement, un éditeur ou un journal) à attribuer (« les Parties à Attribuer ») dans l’avertissement sur les droits d’auteur de l’Offrant, les conditions d’utilisation ou, par un autre moyen approprié, le nom de la Partie ou des Parties à Attribuer ; (ii) le titre de l’Œuvre, s’il est mentionné ; (iii) dans la mesure du possible, l’URI que l'Offrant spécifie comme étant associée à l’Œuvre, sauf si ledit URI ne fait pas référence à l’avertissement sur les droits ou aux informations sur la licence relative à l’Œuvre ; et, (iv) conformément à l’Article 3(b), dans le cas d’une Adaptation, une mention identifiant l’utilisation de l'Œuvre dans l’Adaptation (par exemple « traduction française de l’Œuvre par le Titulaire de Droits Originaire » ou « scénario fondé sur l’Œuvre du Titulaire de Droits Originaire »). Les crédits requis par cet article 4(c) pourront être mis en œuvre par tout moyen approprié, sous réserve, toutefois, qu’en cas d’Adaptation ou de Collection, ces crédits figurent d’une manière au moins aussi visible que les crédits relatifs aux autres auteurs y ayant contribué, si de tels crédits apparaissent. A toutes fins utiles, l'Acceptant ne pourra utiliser les crédits requis par cet Article qu'à des fins d’attribution, de la manière susmentionnée et en exerçant les droits accordés par la Licence. L'Acceptant ne peut, implicitement ou explicitement, affirmer ou laisser supposer une quelconque relation, parrainage ou aval par le Titulaire de Droits Originaire, l'Offrant, la ou les Parties à Attribuer selon le cas, et l’Acceptant ou son utilisation de l’Œuvre, sans avoir l’autorisation distincte, expresse, écrite et préalable du Titulaire de Droits Originaire, de l'Offrant et/ou des Parties à Attribuer.
Pour éviter toute ambiguïté, les restrictions accordées par l’article 3 et les articles 4(a) et 4(b) ne sont pas applicables à la partie de l’œuvre qui est soumise uniquement aux droits des producteurs de bases de données.
A moins d’une limitation aux droits exclusifs prévue par la loi applicable, si l’Acceptant Reproduit, Distribue ou Représente l’Œuvre en elle-même, ou au sein d’une Adaptation ou d’une Collection, il doit respecter les droits moraux du Titulaire de Droits Originaire dans la mesure où ce Titulaire en bénéficie (comme les auteurs et les artistes-interprètes) et ne peut y renoncer.
5. Représentation, Garanties et Avertissement
SAUF ACCORD CONTRAIRE CONVENU PAR ECRIT ENTRE LES PARTIES ET DANS LA LIMITE DU DROIT APPLICABLE, L’OFFRANT MET L’ŒUVRE A DISPOSITION DE L’ACCEPTANT EN L’ETAT, SANS DECLARATION OU GARANTIE D’AUCUNE SORTE, EXPRESSE, IMPLICITE, LÉGALE OU AUTRE. SONT NOTAMMENT EXCLUES LES GARANTIES CONCERNANT LA COMMERCIABILITE, LA CONFORMITE, LES VICES CACHES ET LES VICES APPARENTS.
6. Limitation de responsabilité. A l'exception des garanties d'ordre public imposées par la loi applicable, l'Offrant ne sera en aucun cas tenu responsable vis-à-vis de l'Acceptant, sur la base d'aucune théorie juridique ni en raison d'aucun préjudice direct, indirect, matériel ou moral, résultant de l'exécution du présent Contrat ou de l'utilisation de l'Œuvre, y compris dans l'hypothèse où l'Offrant avait connaissance de la possible existence d'un tel préjudice.
7. Résiliation
Toute violation par l'Acceptant des clauses de cette Licence entraînera sa résiliation automatique et la fin des droits qui en découlent. Les Licences accordées aux personnes physiques ou morales qui ont reçu de la part de l'Acceptant des Adaptations ou des Collections dans le cadre de la présente Licence ne seront pas résiliées, à condition que lesdites personnes physiques ou morales respectent pleinement leurs obligations. Les articles 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 et 8 de la présente Licence continuent à s'appliquer après la résiliation de celle-ci.
Sous réserve des conditions mentionnées ci-dessus, la présente Licence est accordée pour toute la durée du droit d'auteur ou tout autre droit applicable à l'Œuvre. Néanmoins, l'Offrant se réserve à tout moment le droit d'exploiter l'Œuvre sous une autre Licence ou d'en cesser la Distribution à tout moment. Cependant, cette décision ne devra pas conduire à retirer cette Licence (ou toute autre Licence qui a été accordée, ou doit être accordée en application de la présente Licence) qui continuera à s'appliquer dans tous ses effets à moins qu'elle ne soit résiliée dans les conditions décrites ci-dessus.
8. Divers
Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente l’Œuvre ou une Collection, l’Offrant accorde au bénéficiaire suivant, une licence sur l’Œuvre avec les mêmes termes et conditions que celle accordée à l’Acceptant.
Lorsque l’Acceptant distribue ou représente une Adaptation, l’Offrant accorde au bénéficiaire une licence sur l’œuvre dans des conditions identiques à celles accordées à l’Acceptant.
Si en vertu de la loi applicable, une quelconque disposition de la présente Licence était déclarée nulle, non valide ou inapplicable, cela n'aurait pas pour effet d'annuler ou de rendre inapplicables les autres dispositions de la Licence. Sans action ultérieure des parties, ladite disposition sera modifiée dans la mesure minimum nécessaire à sa validité et son applicabilité.
Aucune des conditions ou des dispositions de la présente Licence ne sera réputée comme ayant fait l'objet d'une renonciation, et aucune violation comme ayant été acceptée, sans le consentement écrit et signé de la partie concernée.
La présente Licence représente l'intégralité de l'accord conclu entre les parties à propos de l'Œuvre, objet de la présente Licence. Il n'existe aucun élément annexe, accord ou mandat portant sur cette Œuvre qui ne soit mentionné ci-dessus. L'Offrant ne sera tenu par aucune disposition supplémentaire qui pourrait apparaître dans une communication provenant de l'Acceptant. La présente Licence ne peut être modifiée sans l'accord écrit de l'Offrant et de l'Acceptant.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
